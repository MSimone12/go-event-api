# go-event-api

This API is made based off of a technical challenge

## Setup

In order to run this API, you need to have [go](https://go.dev) installed in you machine, you will also need [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) to be able to create the API endpoint (API key is included)

## Run

to run the API, all you got to do is run:

```bash
make run
```

this will setup the server to test the API on an external endpoint, which is fixed as [https://pleasing-ample-lab.ngrok-free.app](https://pleasing-ample-lab.ngrok-free.app)
